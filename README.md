## Features

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or later
- **yt-dlp** library
- FFmpeg (installed and accessible via your system's PATH)

---

## Installation

1. Install **yt-dlp**:

   ```bash
   pip install yt-dlp
   ```

2. Install FFmpeg:

   - **Linux**: Use your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install ffmpeg` for Ubuntu).
   - **Mac**: Use Homebrew: `brew install ffmpeg`.
   - **Windows**: Download the binaries from [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add them to your system PATH.

---

## Usage

1. Save the script to a file, e.g., `download_audio.py`.

2. Run the script with the YouTube URL as an argument:

   ```bash
   python download_audio.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example"
   ```

3. The audio will be downloaded and saved as an MP3 file in the `audios/` directory. The filename will match the video title.

---

## Example

```bash
python download_audio.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"
```

Output:
```
Downloaded: Veridis Quo
Finished downloading
```

## Notes

- Ensure your system has FFmpeg installed and properly configured.
- The script creates an `audios/` directory in the current working directory if it doesn't already exist.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Timeout Errors**: If downloads take too long, ensure the `socket_timeout` value is appropriate or check your internet connection.
- **Missing FFmpeg**: If conversion to MP3 fails, confirm that FFmpeg is installed and in your PATH.
